# React Blaster
 
React Blaster is a space-themed point and click target-practice game, styled after classic arcade and retro games. As my final project for The Flatiron School, the game relies heavily on manipulation of state, and passing information between components.

This game was built using a Rails backend (found here: https://github.com/CastagnaTM/react_blaster_backend)
