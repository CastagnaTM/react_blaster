# React Blaster
Play the game: https://react-blaster.herokuapp.com/

React Blaster is a space-themed point and click target-practice game, styled after classic arcade and retro games. As my final project for The Flatiron School, the game relies heavily on manipulation of state, and passing information between components.

This game was built using a Rails backend (found here: https://github.com/CastagnaTM/react_blaster_backend), and React frontend.

All styling and animation was done in CSS, featuring Hover.CSS by Ian Lunn (https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) for most buttons in the game.

All art assets were drawn by me, using GIMP.

All music was custom made. 

Playing the game:
React Blaster features in-game instructions, as well as example GIFS for every level. The general structure of the game is simple. Each level features a grid of targets that shuffle every two seconds, for 30 seconds. The grid includes targets you want to click on to destroy, and targets you want to avoid. 
Destroying the correct targets earns you points, which can be spent in the shop for health and weapon upgrades. Destroying the wrong targets can cost you points, health, or cause you to lose the level. 
To beat any level, you must finish the level with a certain number points (your goal is given before each level), and without destroying too many of the wrong targets or running out of health.
The game currently features three levels and a boss fight, and can be played using a mouse or just the trackpad.

Updates:
I have many updates planned for this game, which will be listed here as they are added in.
